Emotion Detection with Multimodal Data
This repository provides a neural network-based emotion detection system using three types of data: text, speech, and motion capture (mocap). The system combines these modalities to classify emotions from input data.

Key Components
AttentionDecoder Class: A custom layer implementing an attention mechanism for sequence data, enhancing the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.

Model Architecture:

Text Model: Processes text sequences using embedding and LSTM layers to extract features.
Speech Model: Handles speech features with LSTM and AttentionDecoder layers, followed by dense layers for feature extraction.
Mocap Model: Analyzes motion capture data using convolutional layers to extract spatial features.
Combined Model: Merges outputs from text, speech, and mocap models and applies dense layers to perform emotion classification.
Training
Data Preparation: Includes data loading, preprocessing, and feature extraction for text, speech, and mocap data.
Training Process: Trains the combined model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss. Evaluates the model's performance using validation accuracy.
Usage
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. The primary dependencies include TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

Prepare Data: Place your data files in the appropriate directory structure and format.

Run Training: Execute the training script with configuration parameters. Example:

python train.py --dropout 0.2 --textlstm 256 --speechlstm 128 --finalfc 256 --adamlr 0.001 config.json

Review Results: The script outputs the maximum validation accuracy achieved during training.

Configuration
--dropout: Dropout rate for regularization.
--textlstm: Size of the LSTM layer for text data.
--speechlstm: Size of the LSTM layer for speech data.
--finalfc: Size of the final fully connected layer.
--adamlr: Learning rate for the Adam optimizer.

Multimodal Emotion Detection System
This repository contains a comprehensive system for emotion detection utilizing multiple data modalities: text, speech, and motion capture (mocap). The system leverages deep learning techniques to classify emotions based on input from these diverse sources.

Overview
The project integrates three neural network models, each specialized for different types of data:

Text Model: Uses embedding and LSTM layers to process and understand textual data.
Speech Model: Employs LSTM and an attention mechanism to analyze speech features, enhanced by a custom AttentionDecoder layer.
Mocap Model: Applies convolutional layers to process motion capture data for feature extraction.
These models are combined into a unified architecture that merges the outputs of the individual models and performs emotion classification.

Features
Custom Attention Decoder: Implements a sequence-to-sequence attention mechanism to improve the model's focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
Multimodal Fusion: Integrates features from text, speech, and mocap data for a more robust emotion detection model.
Flexible Configuration: Allows adjustment of key parameters such as dropout rates, LSTM sizes, and learning rates.
Getting Started
Dependencies: Ensure that you have Python and the required libraries installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

Data Preparation: Organize your data into the required format and directory structure.

Training: Run the training script with the necessary configuration parameters. Example command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --dropout 0.2 --textlstm 256 --speechlstm 128 --finalfc 256 --adamlr 0.001 config.json
Results: After training, the script will output the highest validation accuracy achieved.

Configuration Options
--dropout: Set dropout probability for regularization.
--textlstm: Configure the size of the LSTM layers for text data.
--speechlstm: Set the size of the LSTM layers for speech data.
--finalfc: Define the size of the final fully connected layer.
--adamlr: Specify the learning rate for the Adam optimizer.
